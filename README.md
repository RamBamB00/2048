A classic single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to reach the value 2048. Players use arrow keys or touch controls to move tiles, causing them to merge when they collide with tiles of the same value. The game ends when there are no legal moves left or the 2048 tile is created.

Features:

    Core mechanics: Tile movement, merging, spawning, game over/win conditions
    Optional features (consider adding these based on your project's scope):
        Score tracking
        Difficulty levels
        Undo functionality
        Visual and sound effects
